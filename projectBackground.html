            <h2>MOTIVATION</h2>
            <p>The original motivation for this project came from the discovery of a project known as the ‘Android
                Parking Booking Project’. The main goal of this project was to give users a way to find and reserve
                parking spaces ahead of time so that did not need to search for one when they arrived at their
                destination. Seeing the advanced criteria and usefulness of this project we thought it’d be great to not
                only expand on this idea but popularise it as it could be very helpful with day-to-day tasks, as well as
                give us a challenge to improve our IT abilities.
                <br>
                <br>
                Being road users ourselves, we understand the frustration that comes with finding a parking space, so
                this would be a great investment to reduce the number of cars driving around looking for somewhere to
                park, especially during peak hour. We know what it is like having to drive around looking for somewhere
                to park, and what it is using apps that are not the most user friendly. Therefore, we are in a good
                position to build a helpful and efficient app for users who drive often.
                <br>
                <br>
                By getting a start on this project now, despite the COVID-19 pandemic being a current worldwide issue,
                we would be getting ahead of any other possible competitors. Having an application like this, especially
                when people start going out more often. This would be a great opportunity to get ahead and become
                popular with the consumers who find it difficult to find a parking spot. We also stress that our goal is
                not to copy the original project, but rather expand upon the idea and include our own personal features
                that we feel would benefit.
            </p>

            <h2>AIM AND GOALS</h2>
            <p><b>AIM: </b></p>
            <p>'Quick Park' application aims to reduce stress among road users by creating a parking booking system that allows users to secure a carpark within metropolitan areas.  Thereby alleviating waiting times, road congestions and the hassle of finding a parking space for your vehicle in build-up areas throughout the city.  </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Registration and Profile Editing  Goal: </b></p>
            <p>The goal of this feature is to provide the basic information about the user and their statistical information surrounding their parking behaviours in an easy to navigate, yet personal and informative page. It should give the user a method of tracking their preferences which allow the user to make informed choices for surrounding the aims of the app.  </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Quick Bookings Goals</b></p>
            <p> This feature allows the user to find the most suitable parking for them depending on their preferences in terms of cost, area and other specificities requested by the user. This will be in a form that is logical and easy to navigate as there will be specific preferences that must be accommodated for.  </p>
            <br>
            <p><b> Live Tracking and Built-in GPS Goals</b></p>
            <p>Utilise live GPS tracking capabilities of the device that the user is using (with permission) to find the most suitable parking depending on the specificities from the user. It should be able to minimise the actions required of the user to be able to make the app as reliable and hassle-free as possible. It should also be able to integrate other features to tailor the options provided to the user to find the best parking possible.  </p>
            <br>
            <p><b> Payment Goals</b></p>
            <p> The payment section provides a flexible way to pay for the parking. It provides a variety of methods to pay be it manual options for one-time payments or repetitive and allow the user to pay in advance to increase the efficiency of the payment process and the overall efficiency of the app. </p>
            <br>
                 <p><b> Contact Us and Feedback Goals</b></p>
            <p> The goals of the contact us and feedback feature is to allow users to share their opinions and suggestions about the service provided. This would benefit the business as it will be easy to track and respond to complaints and questions, which would lead to satisfied customers. The contact us and feedback page will allow users to submit anonymous feedback an option to connect support in a non-urgent scenario, thereby collecting useful data to improve business services and procedures.  </p>

            <h2>SCOPE</h2>
            <p>The scope of our project was to have a somewhat functional application of our idea, ‘Quick Park.’ We
                planned to at least deliver an idea of this through some form like a prototype or even just small
                mock-ups of what we believe our application would look like in the final stages. We had hope to gain the
                knowledge of how to go about the production of the application throughout this course, but our plans
                changed once we understood that we would have to likely learn this without much guidance from a lecturer
                or tutor. Early on, we decided to research and get some ideas on how to develop an application. This
                helped us get an idea on the possibilities of what we could make, as such our scope planned to have a
                functioning prototype, so with the minimal viable features in tact as much as we feel we can accomplish.
                We also planned to have this usable on a mobile device, which would greatly help our idea of making the
                application feel convenient and easy to use.</p>
