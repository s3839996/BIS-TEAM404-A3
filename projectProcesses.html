            <h2>Max</h2>
            <p>I have learnt that by working within this group, that communication and everyone doing their part is key.
                If not everyone is participating within their designated work or is not telling the group any issues
                that may be arising, the group’s final product may suffer and as such make it harder to sell an idea. It
                also may cause things to go behind schedule, it’s crucial to make sure everyone is doing their part, and
                constantly communicating with the team as to what tasks they’re currently doing. I believe communication
                has worked quite well for our group, as we’ve had weekly meetings and are always on track with what is
                expected from each of us. We are also great at listening to each other’s ideas, as no one in the group
                has been disrespectful or interrupted each other once to my knowledge. The one thing we may need to work
                on is our ideas and problem solving. Often times when we hit a bump, our project slows down because we
                struggle to think of new ideas. Other than that though, we tend to work quite well as a group and are
                able to make decisions we are all happy with. </p>

            <p>We often asked our mentor questions about certain parts of the assignment if we were having issues
                grasping certain concepts/tasks that were required of us. This helped us sometimes if we couldn’t figure
                out how to approach something or if we needed more information on what was required for a certain
                specification within the assignment. We couldn’t make much use of our lecturer, as they weren’t around
                much to give us guidance apart from the occasional Canvas post. We did get some feedback during our
                meetings with him, but that was it. As stated before, we also tried to contact each other at least once
                a week and keep each other informed in what tasks we are doing each week. This has been a standard for
                us, but we have dropped off a couple of weeks if we have been more busy with other courses. Our
                communication has remained quite consistent though, and so we felt we’ve done quite well throughout this
                semester in terms of sticking to our rules. </p>

            <p>In my opinion, the most important aspect of a project like this is having motivation, an idea and strive
                for your project as a group. We struggled at the start with coming up with an idea, as we didn’t have
                much motivation that aligned with each other for a particular project. This made it difficult to get
                started, as well as decide on a project originally. Afterwards though, we did eventually come up with an
                idea and as such we started to get back on track. If we were to repeat this project, I’d personally try
                to come up with a project as soon as we could, giving us more time as well as finding one that aligns
                with all our interests for more motivation. While we have been motivated for this project, it was
                difficult at first especially as this was a new course for us all and weren’t sure what to try at first.
            </p>

            <p>The best advice I could give is to start early and really research what you’ll need to do for the
                project. Ask as many questions as you can about what’s required, as if the format remains the same,
                you’ll only have two lectures with minimal contact with your lecturer. Have a clear idea of what’s
                expected, strive to work on some aspects early while you don’t have other assignments, and try to make
                the project something you’d be fascinated with. Use the resources you have while you can effectively,
                and most importantly use your time and communication effectively, as both can go by quite quickly if not
                regularly checked. Also make sure to be in a group you think you’ll work well with, and if you start
                seeing some inactive members or ones that just aren’t doing their part, alert your tutor right away.
            </p>

            <h2>Josh</h2>
            <p>I learned how important it is for the entire team to communicate regularly and make sure that everyone
                understands their roles in the team, and what needs to be done. Few things haven’t worked well because
                our team has had a good understanding and we have simply done the work that was required. Something that
                hasn’t worked well is Trello, I think that it is a good tool for telling the team where you are at, but
                I don’t think it should have to be used as a word document with all of the work on it. </p>

            <p>Our mentor looked over the teams work during our tutorials and suggested things to fix and/or change that
                would make our work better. For example, Ivan suggested that instead of having a Use Case Diagram for
                each feature, it would be better to create on large UCD which incorporated all of the minimum viable
                features. We didn’t really get any ‘guidance’ from our lecturer because we didn’t have any
                classes/lectures with him. We only had one meeting with him where he gave feedback on the project, which
                was the meeting at the beginning of the semester where he had to approve the project. </p>

            <p>Whenever a member in a group needed to discuss something with the group, they just messaged the group on
                Microsoft Teams. In our group contract we agreed upon a maximum time that it would take for a team
                member to respond. In addition, the team also had meetings regularly to discuss our progress and what
                still needs to be completed. This method of communicating was very efficient for our team and we have
                had no issues with it. The groups communication methods have not varied extensively as the group has
                always had good communication. </p>

            <br>

            <h2>Ranitha</h2>
            <p>Group projects have shown me that the workload can be split up to different people depending on their
                strengths and how they work etc. This enhances not only the efficiency of completing the work but also
                the quality of the work completed if the work is split through the people corresponding to their
                strengths. The first part of the above statements has been executed well, as the work was completed more
                efficiently. Whereas the weakness was also highlighted as all the members work at different paces and at
                different times, therefore achieving a uniformity of the work was very dependent on the communication of
                the group members. This highlights the how crucial communication is in group projects. </p>

            <p>During the tutorial sessions, I would use the time to discuss and clarify any doubts that the group had
                from the assignment specifications. As well as checking and seeking feedback about completed sections of
                the task in order to better improve it and reach a good satisfactory level. The meetings with the
                lecturer enabled to get a good insight on our project idea and the possible implications/challenges we
                could possibly face with selecting this particular idea. Later we were able to develop our idea and gain
                feedback on the progress and clarify any doubts we had in regard to the assessment tasks. </p>

            <p>We mainly used ‘Teams’ as the platform to communicate with the group members and used the private team
                channel to schedule team meetings and post any questions to the group members, whereby members were able
                to participate in group discussions. The use of ‘Teams’ was highly effective as it provided clarity and
                allowed for the delegation of the workload. Our group Team404, would schedule weekly meetings to discuss
                the workload and how to approach it given the time constraints. Due to the COVID-19 constraints, face to
                face meetings were not possible, hence everything was limited to be completed online. Overall, we worked
                effectively and approached each task in a structured manner, thereby enabling for satisfactory
                completion of tasks. </p>

            <p>I think the most important aspect of organising a project is being able to identify the work required for
                each part of the project and which are the key elements of the project. Once this is done, assigning it
                to the members the best way possible as to maximise the efficiency and quality of the work is very
                important. A consistent program plan for checking in on the work being done and, on the members, and
                their needs is extremely crucial, as to stay versatile yet stable and swift if problems were to arise.
            </p>

            <h2>Michael</h2>
            <p>I have learnt that communication within a group is extremely important, especially when it comes to
                ensuring that each member understands what expected of them. Poor communication may have an impact on
                more than just the working environment, but also the final product itself, and can even lead to a
                project going off schedule. Our group has got along extremely well with good vibes, and we are all more
                than happy to whatever, whenever, and for whoever. We have always been respectful to each other, and we
                have meetings regularly where we discuss progress and ideas. In terms of what hasn’t worked well, some
                members may work at different paces due to other commitments, thus, they do complete the work but just
                at a later time. </p>

            <p>If we were ever unsure of assignment requirements (which was quite regularly), we would ask our mentor
                for clarification. In some cases, this helped us, but in others we were still a bit confused due to the
                conflict and differences between the assignment specification, the rubric, and the advice of our mentor,
                as they didn’t seem to match up at all. In terms of the lecturer, we didn’t have weekly lectures, which
                was definitely the downside to this course, so we didn’t get much guidance from the lecturer besides the
                meeting with had with him. Our main communicating process heavily revolved around Microsoft Teams, in
                which we would send messages, tag other members, or send other files. We also had frequent meetings on
                teams at least once a week, but sometimes we wouldn’t be able to meet due to other commitments and
                subjects. In comparison to the start of the semester, we spent a lot of time of the first assignment,
                setting a very high standard for ourselves, but then realised it was only worth 5%. As the semester went
                on, and we got busier with other subjects, we have been unable to focus as much in this subject, but we
                have been able to do work when we can. </p>

            <p>The most important thing when organising any project, it is important to ensure that all members are
                confident in the idea and are actually motivated to work through the project. When thinking of our
                project idea, our group struggled a lot, making it a very slow start to the project. In terms of doing
                things differently, I would choose a project idea that would be a lot simpler to develop given our
                current skillset, but at the time of choosing our idea, we never expected that we would actually have to
                develop it. </p>

            <p>The main advice I would give would mainly be around asking any and all questions when unsure of any
                requirements, but also conducting as much research as possible in relation to your idea. Use all
                resources you have access to, and most important, stay in very frequent contact with your team members,
                and remember, your team members are your friends for the duration of the project (or maybe even after
                the project …) </p>

            <br>

            <h2>Daniel</h2>
            <p>For group projects, I’ve learnt that communication is key. If there’s no communication within a group,
                then you’re not going to achieve your goal and you’ll fail as a whole. Planning is also a big factor in
                group projects. You need to be organised and understand who is in charge of what so that there is no
                overlap or parts of the project left out. Our group has communicated well with each other and we would
                have constant meetings where we would divide up tasks and update each other on where we were at. We’ve
                worked so well as a team that I don’t think there have been things that haven’t worked well. </p>

            <p>Ivan was great for getting feedback on our weekly work, although in my opinion the five hours minimum
                rule was a little harsh especially because there wasn’t always an opportunity to do five hours of work
                whether that’d be because we were ahead of schedule or because other subjects were conflicting with this
                one. We didn’t get as much feedback from our lecturer as we only met with him a couple of times
                throughout the semester and there was only one lecture for the semester. However, he did give feedback
                on our verbal communication which I found useful as we will be doing a recorded video for our final
                submission. The main process for group communication was text and audio chats through Microsoft Teams.
                Due to the COVID-19 pandemic there wasn’t a chance to meet in person and so everything was done online.
                It worked out well as we could easily schedule a meeting when we were all free and it wouldn’t be an
                extra burden of travelling around to meet in person. The process has remained the same since the start
                of the semester mainly because there wasn’t an opportunity to change meeting processes. </p>

            <p>The most important aspect of organising a project of this nature is to keep an eye on the due dates of
                the three assignments and when things have to be completed by. Also, keeping an eye of what needs to be
                completed in each assignment and use that to determine whether your projects needs to be simplified.
                Unfortunately, we only have three weeks for the final part of the assignment and that is when all of the
                app development needs to be completed, however this was unclear until the third assignment was released,
                so it is likely that the three weeks are going to be very stressful not just with this project but with
                other assignments that will be submitted around the same time. </p>

            <p>If there’s any advice I could provide it would be to always be prepared for something to be unclear and
                always seek clarification. Not everything you need to know will be explored in lectures and tutorials so
                always have outside research ready to assist you. Make sure there is communication with your team and
                that everyone is aware of what needs to be done. If a team member isn’t cooperating, let them know that
                and if things still aren’t resolved make a collective decision as a team on what should be done. </p>
