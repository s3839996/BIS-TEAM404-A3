            <h2>Max</h2>
            <p>In terms of what was easy for the project, I’d say it was relatively easy developing ideas for our
                project in terms of what features to implement and what format it should be in. While the original idea
                was difficult to come up with, once we figured it out we knew how to go about it straight away. We also
                found it quite easy to assign tasks to one another, thanks to Michael as our head leader for getting us
                together and communicating our ideas for how to go about certain tasks. In terms of difficulty and
                unexpectedness, it was quite difficult fully understanding what was required of the assignment, as
                sometimes we’d have trouble understanding the specs and the way certain tasks were outlined, so we would
                have to ask our tutor about it. We also found it a bit difficult to know how to approach certain tasks,
                as some things we were unfamiliar with such as certain diagrams and we do wish we had some explanation
                on how to do these prior to the assessment. </p>

            <p>I had expected the team to have trouble communicating, especially from me as I am quite shy with new
                people and struggled last year in Intro to IT. However, this issue was quickly put to rest as the team
                and I bounced off each other quite well and seemed to communicate mostly well. I had addressed my
                shyness by getting to know my teammates better, which has helped both in organising tasks and discussing
                the assignment with them. It has also lead to us having some good humour between us, which keeps our
                morales high despite these current times of being locked inside. </p>

            <p>I felt I have learnt how to better handle tasks as well as communicate with a team more smoothly. The
                Trello Board has helped me be organised with setting deadlines for myself and staying on task, and the
                general environment of working in a group has been very helpful with learning how to best communicate
                and work with people I haven’t worked with previously. Overall, I felt I have learnt how to better work
                within a team compared to last semester. </p>

            <p>In terms of how plans changed, we often found it difficult to focus on this assignment due to other
                pressing work from other courses. Because of this, we felt sometimes we had either a lot to do one week,
                or not much at all to do in another. If I were to try this again, I’d create a timetable for when things
                should be completed, giving me enough time to finish the tasks while also setting time aside for work
                within other courses. Overall though, things have worked out rather well for our assignments and
                progress anyway, but could be improved for sure. </p>

            <p>We didn’t have much of a set in stone timetable, which is what might’ve been our biggest issue. We mainly
                planned as the weeks came along, and I feel if I were to do this again I’d make a timetable outlining
                our entire work to be done for the assignment. This would help us have a concrete idea of what’s
                expected and when to have it completed by, leaving less room for uncertainty and slipping behind. </p>

            <p>The tools we used were quite useful, especially Teams, GitHub and Trello. Teams helped us communicate
                with one another on a consistent basis, GitHub allowed us to all work on several HTML documents so that
                they could be uploaded to AWS by someone, and lastly Trello really helped with organising our tasks into
                cards, as well as having our information all presented in an alternate format to be read. One big risk
                is that if internet is not functioning, we can’t really use these tools effectively, but this rarely
                happened and if it did, hasn’t impacted our work significantly. </p>

            <h2>Josh</h2>
            <p>It has been easy being able to rely on my team, I haven’t had to constantly remind them to do their part.
                The difficult part of this project was having to build an entire app without having any classes/lectures
                on how to build apps, or their documentation (such as IPO charts, Architecture diagrams, and validation
                criteria). Being given a link to a YouTube video or a website wasn’t very helpful in figuring out what
                we needed to do. </p>

            <p>I knew that most of the assignments would be challenging because we were not taught any content relating
                to building IT systems. Also, I have never had any experience with things such as architecture diagrams
                or app development. Even though these are big challenges to overcome, my team and I have continued to
                work together and help each other when we were unsure about something. </p>

            <p>Since starting this course I have learned the basics of architecture diagrams and app development. I have
                also learned how to work better as a team. I learned how to use Trello, to ensure that the team is kept
                up to date and knows what I am currently doing, and what need to be done. I would most likely start the
                app development earlier since the time given in assignment 3 was definitely not enough. </p>

            <p>Our timetable that we made was mainly for completing the assignments, since the first two assignments
                didn’t involve and development, we didn’t think about it. But knowing now that we would only have a few
                weeks to make an entire app I would have made a more detailed timetable for the entire semester which
                included starting the development earlier. </p>

            <p>Most of our tools have been great to use as a team. We used Microsoft Teams to chat and have our meetings
                with. We also used Trello to keep track of the groups process with the assignments. The only issue with
                these is that if a team member had technical difficulties such as losing internet we would have to
                continue the meeting without them, but we didn’t let this affect us, we simply updated them on what they
                missed and continued meeting with each other. </p>

            <br>

            <h2>Ranitha</h2>
            <p>The members of Team404 have been great in maintaining constant communication and completing allocated
                tasks on time and without much additional pressures. Each member will be dedicated to attend the group
                meeting which made the group communication and team bonding stronger, enabling for more meaningful
                discussions and areas to learn and grow. The most difficult part of the Quick Park project is to develop
                a fully functional application with basic programming knowledge. A lot of research was required taken to
                be able to figure out the basic aspects and how the application can be possibly built incorporating the
                minimum viable features. Not having lectures, restricted individuals to satisfactorily complete the
                tasks, due to a lack of knowledge of the required topics and concepts. The most unexpected part of this
                project is that the project involves building an application from scratch without being taught on how to
                develop an application. </p>

            <p>Due to the current COVID situation and formation of groups on an online platform I expected that the team
                communication and time management would definitive be effected and that could play a factor of the
                overall product of Team 404’s work. However, this wasn’t the case and in order to address the
                foreseeable issue, more attentive care was taken to create new group meetings and ensure that all team
                members were aware and participating in the group discussions. Involving the group members to share
                their opinions on the completed tasks or parts of task where I was unsure about allowed for better
                development of team dynamics and ultimately assisted in completing the required assignment task. I also
                expected that building and developing an application from scratch without guidance of lectures would
                have been difficult and to address this concern I have been attentive and attended all the tutorial
                sessions to clarify any questions/doubts that weren’t clear within the assignment specifications. In
                some cases, this was helpful, and the questions were able to be clearly explained at base level, however
                further research was required to fully understand the required concepts. </p>

            <p>Building IT systems has strengthened my communication skills both verbally and written. I have been able
                to express ideas more clearly and design prototypes, create use case diagrams, IPO charts and estimation
                plans. I have learnt to use a few commonly used tools in the IT industry such as Trello, Visual Studio,
                GitHub and AWS. I have also learnt the basics of application development process starting from the
                project idea, prototyping and then the creation of the app. </p>

            <p>Time management was something that took a toll on the overall project plan. As the assignments were
                introduced part by part, our group was not aware that we are required to code a fully functional
                application at the end of the third assignment, which meant that some features of the application that
                were initially planned, required to be scrapped. Next time, better planning and structuring of the
                workload should be done to avoid last minute stresses. The group should focus on developing the
                application and work on parts of the final application development along with the assignment task to be
                able successfully to develop a final project within the given time constraints. </p>

            <p>The lack of knowledge in terms of being expected to develop the complete application, made things more
                difficult in terms of timing. As a team we allocated more time to Assignment 1 and Assignment 2 which
                mainly focused on the project idea and the features rather than focusing on the development of the
                application. However, being more aware of the time constraints and the expectations of project we have
                revised the timetable to focus on the specific tasks that needs to be done to be able to build a fully
                functional car park booking system. </p>

            <p>The tools that we have been currently using such as Trello, Visual Studio, Teams, GitHub, AWS all played
                an important role in structuring and enabling strong communication within the team. All these tools had
                been working quite effectively and no major issues were faced. Internet issues were the only concern for
                these technology applications, which at some points caused lag/ dropouts however these were easily able
                to be conquered and didn’t cause a huge impact on the workload. </p>

            <br>

            <h2>Michael</h2>
            <p>It has been very easy working with a group that communicates well and not having to remind them to do
                their assigned work. The most difficult part of this project was not having all prior knowledge of
                required topics / concepts and having to make a fully functional application with minimal programming
                knowledge. Additionally, having zero lectures covering these concepts made answering some of the
                questions in the assignments very difficult. The most unexpected part of this project was having to
                build a fully functional application with little programming knowledge whilst also not being taught
                anything in class. </p>

            <p>I expected our group to have poor communication and time management, but I thought that it was pretty
                much the opposite of that. I expected the subject would be a lot easier than it is, as I thought that it
                would be treated as more of an introductory subject with plenty of lectures, but it was quite the
                opposite in fact. I have tried asking others question about the assignment specifications when I’m
                unsure, and in some cases that has helped, but in most cases, me and the team did the best we could with
                the specifications, even when it was extremely unclear. </p>

            <p>This subject has mainly improved my skills and comfort in working in groups. I have learnt how to use a
                few commonly used tools in the industry, such as Trello, GitHub and AWS. Through my own research and
                learning, I have learned about the many technical diagrams that are used in software development, such
                as UCD, DFD and SCD. </p>

            <p>As the semester went on, and we got more assignments for other subjects, we had less time to focus on our
                project. At times, we left some things until a bit later, so some weeks were a lot more rushed than
                others. If I were to do anything differently, I would spend the beginning of the project getting ahead
                with the final application development, even though we had no idea that we would have to develop an
                application with little knowledge. </p>

            <p>As we didn’t know that development would be a part of this introductory subject, our timetables mainly
                planned for completing the assignments, rather than development of the application. However, knowing
                what we know now, I would’ve created a timetable that was more specific in outlining the tasks required
                for the final development. </p>

            <p>The tools we used throughout the project were extremely useful. Trello, Teams, GitHub and AWS, just to
                name a few, were very helpful in organising all our work and ensuring proper communication between group
                members. Sometimes members might’ve had internet issues, causing lag or dropouts, but this didn’t have
                too much of an impact on our work. </p>

            <br>

            <h2>Daniel</h2>
            <p>It was easy to gather all the tasks and split them amongst the group members as we split them up in a way
                that would allow us to use our individual strengths to accomplish them. The difficult part was working
                solely online due to the coronavirus pandemic and not being able to meet in purpose to discuss our
                project. The unexpected part of the project was that we would actually be developing our app as previous
                years example assignments show no sign of this. </p>

            <p>I was expecting this subject to be difficult, especially because of the current pandemic that would make
                it harder to work as a group as we’d only be working online and not being at the university. To address
                these, we like to divide all of our work and then go off on our own and complete them before meeting
                again and putting the final touches on the assignment before submitting. So yes, the challenges have
                been overcome. </p>

            <p>I’ve learnt how to work better in a team and how to take charge sometimes. As usually I would sit back
                let other people pick tasks first and then I would take what was left. But this time I felt more
                comfortable to request a certain task to do whether it would be easier for me or impose more of a
                challenge. </p>

            <p>As the final assignment rolled around we definitely had to kick it up a gear as we had a lot of work to
                do in just three weeks along with other subjects that had to be completed. If I had to change the plan
                I’d try and get through Assignment 1 and 2 faster so that there was more time to complete assignment 3.
                More or less, things turned out as expected. </p>

            <p>We didn’t really had a set timetable as we really just tried to get the work done before the assignment
                was due. I’d change it up by leaving less time for work only worth 5% and more time for work that is
                worth most of the final mark. </p>

            <p>Trello was extremely useful for being able to keep track of tasks and allowed other group members to see
                what was done and what still needed to be done. The only risk is that Trello is internet based so if you
                had a poor internet connection the Trello board wouldn’t update and thus the completed work wouldn’t be
                reflected. </p>
