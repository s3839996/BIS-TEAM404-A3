            <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
            <p>TO BE ADDED</p>
            <br>

            <h2>OUTCOMES TO DATE</h2>
            <p>As of the project completion, we’ve been able to get all of our minimum viable features completed. Whilst they may not all be completed to their fullest extent as we had originally planned, we were still able to get majority 
                of their functionality working in the limited and short time that we had to actually develop the program. In our presentation, we will be able to demonstrate the 
                process of a user registering and signing into the app. Contacting the developers of the app to provide feedback, request an enquiry or talk over the phone with the 
                provided phone number. The user will be able to make a quick booking where they can enter their location of choice, as well as the date and time they’d like to 
                park there, and selecting the vehicle they will be driving and their selected payment method. Along with this, they can specifically select the space they’d like 
                to park in. The user is also able to view their profile, they can edit certain details, and manage their payment settings. Finally, 
                a live tracking option is available. This depicts what could happen if the app had a fully fledged GPS option built into it that can 
                guide them to their selected location of parking. </p>

            <br>

            <h2>SCOPE CREEP</h2>
            <p>There are aspects of the app that we weren’t able to complete due to the time constraints or resources
                that we had available to us. We originally planned to develop the app in Java, however we only had a
                short couple of weeks to do real development so we decided to create a representation of the app using
                HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. We also intended to include the integration of the user’s phone voice
                assistant so that they could use it to book a parking space however this was not possible due to the
                time constraint we had and that ultimately it was not feasible to be able to do this. If we could repeat
                this project, we would have less functionality and focus on a few main features that we could really put
                all of our effort into. </p>
            <br>

            <h2>WINDFALL</h2>
            <p>The original plan was to develop our app using the Java programming language. However, we eventually
                discovered that we only had three weeks to develop the final product. It was eventually decided to
                develop the app using HTML and CSS. By developing the app using HTML and CSS we were able to
                significantly reduce the amount of time that we had originally foreseen to develop the app. The benefit
                of HTML is that we could save templates and various design aspects and replicate this multiple times to
                create different pages of the app. Another advantage of HTML is that we were also able to implement the
                PHP language which meant data storage was a lot easier than easily anticipated, and due to our
                experience with PHP in Web Programming, we were able to transfer the skills over to our assignment.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>PROGRESS</h2>
            <p>Based on the estimation plan from Assignment 2, the estimated average time of development was 77 hours.
                The total number of hours in a week is 168 meaning that the development of the project would take less
                than a week's effort of work. Now, we weren’t working on the app 24/7 meaning that we wouldn’t only be
                developing in a week and rather these hours would be spread out over several days and weeks. Not to
                mention that not everyone is developing at the same time so that adds more constraints to the time
                limit. In the three weeks we had to develop the app I’d say we spent less than 77 hours developing the
                app. This is due to the fact that our method of development changed from Java to HTML and most of us
                were already familiar with the HTML concepts needed to develop the app so that reduced the amount of
                learning, research and planning needed to develop the app. Additionally, the use of PHP allowed us to
                save templates for the site which reduced the need for coding and also made the development process more
                efficient.</p>

            <h2>INTEGRATION FOR BUSINESSES</h2>
            <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
            <p>A new feature that could be built into the app is business integration. This would allow business
                managers to create spending accounts for their employees. Users would be able to separate their
                transactions, and businesses would be able to immediately view their employee's receipts. For example,
                if an employee needed to drive to the city for a business meeting, they could put it under the business
                account. This would charge the businesses credit card instead of the employees personal account and the
                business manager would be able to view that transaction to make sure that it was approved. </p>
            <br>

            <h3>USER STORIES</h3>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">“Being the CEO of Uber, I get a lot of complaints from the uber drivers about
                not being able to find
                convenient safe parking nearby the pick-up or drop off locations, therefore want to be able to
                provide them an option to find convenient parking”</p>
            <p>The Quick Park application can be integrated into applications such as Uber to provide Uber drivers with a quick and effortless option of finding a parking location close to their client's pickup or drop off location. Having a guaranteed car park available will indeed support businesses like uber extend their services and increase safety precautions when it comes to uber taxi service. Once the integration for businesses occurs the uber drivers will be able to see the similar app interface to regular Quick Park users, whereby they can see the short-term car parks available nearby the location of choice. The drivers can then have the choice to book the most convenient car park closest to the client's pick-up or drop off location and can indicate to the client that their ride is ready at this location and time. The Quick Park integration for businesses can work hand in hand to support the business increase their services and boost sales. </p>
            <br>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">“As the manager of a busy accounting firm in the city, I would like to
                provide my staff members a facility to find parking effortlessly nearby the firm”</p>
            <p>'Quick Park' can increase its clientele by offering service to businesses at a reasonable rate. Firms that do not have car parking available for staff will need to find parking available for staff members therefore they can ensure their employees attend to work on time. In the case of the accounting firm, the manager can use the Quick Park application to book the car parking slots for a short period and be able to get it at competitive prices. This can entail increase business relationship between Quick Park and other organisations, as parking service is managed effortlessly.

            <h2>INTEGRATION INTO MAPPING SERVICE APPS</h2>
            <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
            <p>Integrating the Quick Park system into a mapping service app such as Google Maps or Apple Maps would make
                users trips more efficient as they would have the ability to link their Quick Park accounts to a mapping
                service app. By linking their accounts users would have the option to automatically book an available
                parking spot nearest to their destination all within the same app. Users would not need to use their
                phone while driving to try and find a parking spot instead they could make the booking as they entered
                their destination into the app or they could book it during their journey by talking to Googles smart
                assistant or Apples Siri which are both integrated into their respective apps. </p>
            <p>By allowing users to speak to their smart assistant while driving we are not only making it simpler for
                people to find a parking location but also creating a safer environment where people have one less
                reason to go on their phones while driving. </p>
            <br>

            <h3>USER STORIES</h3>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">“Being a new resident in Melbourne, I would like to quickly navigate through
                the city and be able to find secure locations to park my vehicle”</p>
            <p>Having the Quick Park application integrated into mapping services will allow for users, especially
                novice users easily navigate through Melbourne and find quick parking quickly and conveniently. The
                application can be integrated in a way that the user does not have to take much effort to switch between
                the two applications (map and the quick park application). Users will be prompted to see the carparks
                available on the way or nearby the location entered by the user. This will increase confidence in
                drivers and help them save time and energy trying to find a parking lot. </p>

            <h2>PRICE COMPARISION</h2>
            <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
            <p>Parking in the city can become very costly even for just a few hours. Quick Park could help solve this
                issue through a price comparison feature. This feature would show various parking locations in a
                specified area in order to allow its user to find the best parking spot for them. A user might be
                willing to spend more money to park closer to where they want to go, or maybe the user wants to save a
                few dollars and instead walk. That is what this feature would allow its users to choose. </p>
            <br>

            <h3>USER STORIES</h3>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">“Being a member of a medium budget family, I would like to compare parking
                prices of nearby carparks and get the best deal”</p>
            <p>Displaying the market prices can be beneficial for users who are on a tight budget. Quick Park can offer
                exclusive deals and ensure that their prices are competitive, thereby encouraging a greater pool of
                individuals to utilise the service. Users having the option to see the other competitor business prices
                and then compare to Quick Park’s reasonable prices and service will help users to make the decision on
                which organisation to support. Quick Park can aim to match or beat other organisation’s prices and be on
                top of providing excellent service at affordable prices to all kinds of users. </p>
            <br>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">“As a student I would like to be able to compare and receive the cheapest
                bargain available to find a quick and affordable carpark”</p>
            <p>Quick Park can aim to support students and teenagers in finding affordable parking nearby the location of
                their choice. The price comparison feature will come in handy as these group on individuals typically
                are low on budget and would like to receive the lowest possible price point. Hence displaying all the
                prices, available and then highlighting the current rates that is offered by Quick Park can increase
                loyalty from clients to the business. In future Quick Park can aim to provide booster packages for
                students that enable them to access affordable parking effortlessly. </p>
