            <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
            <p>Quick Park began in 2020 when Team 404 wanted to make it easier for people to find parking, especially in
                the CBD where there is lots of traffic. The development of the 'Quick Park' application will assist
                users to conveniently park their vehicles amidst all the hustle bustle within the city. Users are
                required to install the application, register their vehicle, enter their card details, location and get
                started. During the initial analysis stages the team created descriptions to outline what the app would
                do, including each feature. We also created architecture diagrams such as IPO charts, and UCD charts,
                and more which were going to be used to show how the system works.

                <br><br>

                During the development of the app we discovered that due to our limited knowledge of app development we
                would need to change from an actual app. We decided that the next best option for the app would be to
                create a mobile website. Using our knowledge of PHP, HTML, and CSS we created a website for the app. We
                also needed to downscale some of our features to make them more reasonable. For example, for the view
                bookings feature we couldn’t get it to view the bookings from the JSON files, therefore we could not
                develop that feature. Another example would be the directions/live tracking feature which we had to
                develop with limited functionality. Currently the user cannot select a destination, but instead it only
                shows a fixed location to show that the feature works.

                <br><br>

                An example of a feature that was completed is the directions to the destination in the live tracking
                feature. Under the interactive map in the Quick Park app, the user can read the step by step directions
                to their destination.

                <br><br>

                Overall, our app did not differ too much for our original plan, even though we needed to make the app
                into a mobile website, the app still functions similarly to what we originally thought.

                <br><br>

                One of our biggest issues that we had was time. Due to our time constraint we did not have the time to
                fully develop the application. Due to this we had to scale back some features which we mentioned above.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2>OUTCOMES TO DATE</h2>
            <p>As of the project completion, we’ve been able to get all of our minimum viable features completed. Whilst
                they may not all be completed to their fullest extent as we had originally planned, we were still able
                to get majority
                of their functionality working in the limited and short time that we had to actually develop the
                program. In our presentation, we will be able to demonstrate the
                process of a user registering and signing into the app. Contacting the developers of the app to provide
                feedback, request an enquiry or talk over the phone with the
                provided phone number. The user will be able to make a quick booking where they can enter their location
                of choice, as well as the date and time they’d like to
                park there, and selecting the vehicle they will be driving and their selected payment method. Along with
                this, they can specifically select the space they’d like
                to park in. The user is also able to view their profile, they can edit certain details, and manage their
                payment settings. Finally,
                a live tracking option is available. This depicts what could happen if the app had a fully fledged GPS
                option built into it that can
                guide them to their selected location of parking. </p>

            <h2>SCOPE CREEP</h2>
            <p>There are aspects of the app that we weren’t able to complete due to the time constraints or resources
                that we had available to us. We originally planned to develop the app in Java, however we only had a
                short couple of weeks to do real development so we decided to create a representation of the app using
                HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. We also intended to include the integration of the user’s phone voice
                assistant so that they could use it to book a parking space however this was not possible due to the
                time constraint we had and that ultimately it was not feasible to be able to do this. If we could repeat
                this project, we would have less functionality and focus on a few main features that we could really put
                all of our effort into. </p>
            <br>

            <h2>WINDFALL</h2>
            <p>The original plan was to develop our app using the Java programming language. However, we eventually
                discovered that we only had three weeks to develop the final product. It was eventually decided to
                develop the app using HTML and CSS. By developing the app using HTML and CSS we were able to
                significantly reduce the amount of time that we had originally foreseen to develop the app. The benefit
                of HTML is that we could save templates and various design aspects and replicate this multiple times to
                create different pages of the app. Another advantage of HTML is that we were also able to implement the
                PHP language which meant data storage was a lot easier than easily anticipated, and due to our
                experience with PHP in Web Programming, we were able to transfer the skills over to our assignment.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>PROGRESS</h2>
            <p>Based on the estimation plan from Assignment 2, the estimated average time of development was 77 hours.
                The total number of hours in a week is 168 meaning that the development of the project would take less
                than a week's effort of work. Now, we weren’t working on the app 24/7 meaning that we wouldn’t only be
                developing in a week and rather these hours would be spread out over several days and weeks. Not to
                mention that not everyone is developing at the same time so that adds more constraints to the time
                limit. In the three weeks we had to develop the app I’d say we spent less than 77 hours developing the
                app. This is due to the fact that our method of development changed from Java to HTML and most of us
                were already familiar with the HTML concepts needed to develop the app so that reduced the amount of
                learning, research and planning needed to develop the app. Additionally, the use of PHP allowed us to
                save templates for the site which reduced the need for coding and also made the development process more
                efficient.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>TESTING</h2>
            <p>We have conducted many tests on our final MVF product. Whilst we had to ‘downgrade’ our features as to
                run on schedule, we did our best in ensuring that they fulfilled the features we did manage to
                implement. Field validation was a common occurring test we conducted, with the all required fields
                having to be filled in (such as can be seen in the contact forms, quick bookings and payment forms).
                Other tests with these forms included storing data in a JSON file. Though this was more for proof of
                concept, as this data isn’t being used for anything. We used a mixture of HTML and PHP Server Side
                validation for the forms. We developed functions in php to handle the read and write to JSON files, and
                we made functions to handle to registration, log in and logging out of the user. </p>

            <h4>Canvas</h4>
            <p>Canvas will be the main source of any assignment updates, specifications, and other updates from the
                lecturer regarding the course. There is also a Canvas group that has been set up with all the members,
                but
                this will not be used throughout assignment development. </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Microsoft Teams</h4>
            <p>Microsoft Teams will be the primary source of communications between group members, mentor, and the
                lecturer, and allows for all members to share work, ideas, and any questions they have. Virtual meetings
                can
                be held on here, which can also be recorded for future reference, by both members and teachers. </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Trello</h4>
            <p>Trello is a tool used to replication the process of using a "Kanban Board", which is used as an agile
                project management tool to visualise work that needs to be completed. As such, all tasks that need to be
                completed are added to the groups Trello Board. When the status of a task changes, it can be reflected
                on
                the Trello Board. Trello is also used to indicate our weekly contributions at our weekly stand-up
                meetings.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Figma</h4>
            <p>Figma is another widely used tool in the industry, being used to create prototypes as to show off the end
                goal of the project. Figma will be used to develop all designs, concepts, as well as a fully functional
                prototype of our application. This will be managed entirely by Daniel. </p>
            <br>

            <h4>LucidChart</h4>
            <p>LucidChart is yet another widely used tool in the industry, being used to create many types of diagrams,
                including flowcharts, use case diagrams, context diagrams, and plenty more that use UML notation. For
                our
                project, LucidChart will be used to collaborate with other members in creating any technical diagrams,
                mainly Use Case Diagrams and System Context Diagrams. </p>
            <br>

            <h4>AWS</h4>
            <p>AWS will be used to host our website and all related files or media. Files can be downloaded from GitHub
                and
                uploaded to AWS in order to get an updated state of the entire website. This will be managed entirely by
                Michael. </p>
            <br>

            <h4>Word Online</h4>
            <p>Word Online will be used to collaborate on most of the worded aspects of the assignment, which also
                allows members to ensure that wording is fluent and correct. </p>
            <br>

            <h4>GitHub</h4>
            <p>GitHub is a widely used tool in the industry, particularly when it comes to programming and software
                development. It allows for members to upload any files, particularly HTML coding, whenever any
                significant
                changes have been. The updated versions can then be accessed by other members, whilst also allowing
                there to
                be the potential to go back to an earlier version in the event of any issues. </p>

            <h4>Website Development (PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript)</h4>
            <p>Web development languages were essential in completing this assignment as they were used to build out
                application
                'Quick Park'. PHP is a very popular coding language which we used to develop the website, along side the
                HTML

            <h2>INTEGRATION FOR BUSINESSES</h2>
            <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
            <p>A new feature that could be built into the app is business integration. This would allow business
                managers to create spending accounts for their employees. Users would be able to separate their
                transactions, and businesses would be able to immediately view their employee's receipts. For example,
                if an employee needed to drive to the city for a business meeting, they could put it under the business
                account. This would charge the businesses credit card instead of the employees personal account and the
                business manager would be able to view that transaction to make sure that it was approved. </p>
            <br>

            <h3>USER STORIES</h3>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">“Being the CEO of Uber, I get a lot of complaints from the uber drivers about
                not being able to find
                convenient safe parking nearby the pick-up or drop off locations, therefore want to be able to
                provide them an option to find convenient parking.”</p>
            <p>The Quick Park application can be integrated into applications such as Uber to provide Uber drivers with
                a quick and effortless option of finding a parking location close to their client's pickup or drop off
                location. Having a guaranteed car park available will indeed support businesses like uber extend their
                services and increase safety precautions when it comes to uber taxi service. Once the integration for
                businesses occurs the uber drivers will be able to see the similar app interface to regular Quick Park
                users, whereby they can see the short-term car parks available nearby the location of choice. The
                drivers can then have the choice to book the most convenient car park closest to the client's pick-up or
                drop off location and can indicate to the client that their ride is ready at this location and time. The
                Quick Park integration for businesses can work hand in hand to support the business increase their
                services and boost sales. </p>

            <br>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">“As the manager of a busy accounting firm in the city, I would like to
                provide my staff members a facility to find parking effortlessly nearby the firm.”</p>
            <p>'Quick Park' can increase its clientele by offering service to businesses at a reasonable rate. Firms
                that do not have car parking available for staff will need to find parking available for staff members
                therefore they can ensure their employees attend to work on time. In the case of the accounting firm,
                the manager can use the Quick Park application to book the car parking slots for a short period and be
                able to get it at competitive prices. This can entail increase business relationship between Quick Park
                and other organisations, as parking service is managed effortlessly.</p>

            <h3>VALIDATION</h3>
            <p>Some methods of validating this feature would be to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Allow businesses to test the beta version to ensure that businesses can efficiently use the app.
                    This could be done by finding businesses that normally pay for their employees transport/parking
                    fees which are also willing to use the app to manage their employee's funds/transactions through the
                    app. </li>
                <li>Check that the using the business features on the app make businesses more efficient compared to
                    users having to manually send their company a receipt and then have that company send the funds back
                    to their employee. This could be checked by asking businesses and employees if they think the
                    process is simpler. </li>
                <li>Include mock-ups (available on Figma and JPEG) </li>
            </ul>
            <br>


            <h2>INTEGRATION INTO MAPPING SERVICE APPS</h2>
            <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
            <p>Integrating the Quick Park system into a mapping service app such as Google Maps or Apple Maps would make
                users trips more efficient as they would have the ability to link their Quick Park accounts to a mapping
                service app. By linking their accounts users would have the option to automatically book an available
                parking spot nearest to their destination all within the same app. Users would not need to use their
                phone while driving to try and find a parking spot instead they could make the booking as they entered
                their destination into the app or they could book it during their journey by talking to Googles smart
                assistant or Apples Siri which are both integrated into their respective apps. </p>
            <p>By allowing users to speak to their smart assistant while driving we are not only making it simpler for
                people to find a parking location but also creating a safer environment where people have one less
                reason to go on their phones while driving. </p>
            <br>

            <h3>USER STORIES</h3>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">“Being a new resident in Melbourne, I would like to quickly navigate through
                the city and be able to find secure locations to park my vehicle.”</p>
            <p>Having the Quick Park application integrated into mapping services will allow for users, especially
                novice users easily navigate through Melbourne and find quick parking quickly and conveniently. The
                application can be integrated in a way that the user does not have to take much effort to switch between
                the two applications (map and the quick park application). Users will be prompted to see the car parks
                available on the way or nearby the location entered by the user. This will increase confidence in
                drivers and help them save time and energy trying to find a parking lot.

            <h3>VALIDATION</h3>
            <p>Some methods for validating this feature could be surveys:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Asking users of the app if they believe being able to book a parking nearest to their destination
                    would be useful. </li>
                <li>Asking users if being able to ask their smart assistant to book a car spot would be a useful feature
                    to have. </li>
                <li>Asking users how often they look at their phones while driving to find somewhere to park (with or
                    without the Quick Park app). </li>
                <li>Once implemented asking users how often they use the built in feature to book a car spot. </li>
                <li>Include mock-ups (available on Figma and JPEG) </li>
            </ul>
            <br>


            <h2>PRICE COMPARISION</h2>
            <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
            <p>Parking in the city can become very costly even for just a few hours. Quick Park could help solve this
                issue through a price comparison feature. This feature would show various parking locations in a
                specified area in order to allow its user to find the best parking spot for them. A user might be
                willing to spend more money to park closer to where they want to go, or maybe the user wants to save a
                few dollars and instead walk. That is what this feature would allow its users to choose. </p>
            <br>

            <h3>USER STORIES</h3>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">“Being a member of a medium budget family, I would like to compare parking
                prices of nearby carparks and get the best deal.”</p>
            <p>Displaying market prices can be beneficial for users who are on a tight budget. Quick Park can offer
                exclusive deals and ensure that their prices are competitive, thereby encouraging a greater pool of
                individuals to utilise the service. Users having the option to see the other competitor business prices
                and then compare to Quick Park’s reasonable prices and service will help users to make the decision on
                which organisation to support. Quick Park can aim to match or beat other organisation’s prices and be on
                top of providing excellent service at affordable prices to all kinds of users. </p>
            <br>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">“As a student I would like to be able to compare and receive the cheapest
                bargain available to find a quick and affordable carpark.”</p>
            <p>Quick Park can aim to support students and teenagers in finding affordable parking near the location of
                their choice. The price comparison feature will come in handy as these group on individuals typically
                are low on budget and would like to receive the lowest possible price point. Hence displaying all the
                prices, available and then highlighting the current rates that are offered by Quick Park can increase
                loyalty from clients to the business. In future Quick Park can aim to provide booster packages for
                students that enable them to access affordable parking effortlessly. </p>
